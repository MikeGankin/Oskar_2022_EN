          In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the philosophy of&nbsp;Action, Oskar Hartmann
          defines &laquo;decathlon&raquo; as&nbsp;a&nbsp;derivative of&nbsp;the meaning
          of&nbsp;life&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;principle that he&nbsp;invented for himself.
          Oskar is&nbsp;convinced that a&nbsp;person should not throw all his strength
          into just one area: business, career, sports or&nbsp;family. Then the other
          aspects of&nbsp;life will remain &laquo;overboard&raquo;. A&nbsp;well-off
          person will be&nbsp;sick and lonely, and a&nbsp;successful athlete will
          be&nbsp;left without means of&nbsp;livelihood.

          Harmony in&nbsp;a&nbsp;
          person&rsquo;s life, according to&nbsp;Hartmann, appears when a&nbsp;person
          equally develops a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;directions. The entrepreneur is&nbsp;
          convinced that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;truly active
          person, being in&nbsp;constant active movement towards his dreams, and
          at&nbsp;the same time be&nbsp;in&nbsp;balance and harmony with himself.
          Oskar shows by&nbsp;his example that with great diligence this is&nbsp;quite
          feasible. &laquo;If&nbsp;you can effectively dose all the components of&nbsp;
          your life&nbsp;&mdash; family, career, relationships, health and hobbies
          &nbsp;&mdash; you will get the most beautiful composition of&nbsp;your life&raquo;&mdash; says Hartmann.
