                  The first business that Oskar became the founder of&nbsp;was a&nbsp;sports nutrition online-store in&nbsp;Germany.

              <p class="section-picture__text">
                  In&nbsp;2010 the entrepreneur created Sapato, a&nbsp;company specializing in&nbsp;the online sales of&nbsp;new shoe
                  collections. Then the first live-TV store in&nbsp;Russia was created&nbsp;&mdash; called Shopping Live, which quickly
                  became the leader in&nbsp;sales among its competitors.

                  In&nbsp;2012 Sapato was acquired by&nbsp;Ozon, and Oskar became a&nbsp;co-shareholder of&nbsp;Ozon.ru. At&nbsp;the same time
                  Hartmann sold the main share of&nbsp;Shopping Live which allowed him to&nbsp;obtain capital to&nbsp;launch a&nbsp;number
                  of&nbsp;his own enterprises: Teamo, Carprice, Relevant Media, HomeMarket, Aktivo, Vitaportal, AutoSpot, Iqcard,
                  Hlebnoe mesto and several Internet companies.
