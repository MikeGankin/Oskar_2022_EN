              In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the philosophy of&nbsp;Action, Oskar Hartmann defines &laquo;decathlon&raquo; as&nbsp;a&nbsp;derivative of&nbsp;the meaning of&nbsp;life&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;principle that he&nbsp;invented for himself. Oskar is&nbsp;convinced that a&nbsp;person should not throw all his strength into just one area: business, career, sports or&nbsp;family. Then the other aspects of&nbsp;life will remain &laquo;overboard&raquo;. A&nbsp;well-off person will be&nbsp;sick and lonely, and a&nbsp;successful athlete will be&nbsp;left without means of&nbsp;livelihood. Harmony in&nbsp;a&nbsp;person&rsquo;s life, according to&nbsp;Hartmann, appears when a&nbsp;person equally develops a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;directions. The entrepreneur is&nbsp;convinced that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;truly active person, being in&nbsp;constant active movement towards his dreams, and at&nbsp;the same time be&nbsp;in&nbsp;balance and harmony with himself.

            <p class="content__text">
              Oskar shows by&nbsp;his example that with great diligence this is&nbsp;quite feasible. &laquo;If&nbsp;you can effectively dose all the components of&nbsp;your life&nbsp;&mdash; family, career, relationships, health and hobbies&nbsp;&mdash; you will get the most beautiful composition of&nbsp;your life,&raquo; says Hartmann. Paying great attention not only to&nbsp;business, but also to&nbsp;sports, creativity, and family, the entrepreneur has identified for himself ten disciplines in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;succeed:
            </p>
            <ul class="content__list content-list content-list--dots">
              <li class="content-list__item">A&nbsp;healthy, energetic, life-loving person,</li>
              <li class="content-list__item">Husband,</li>
              <li class="content-list__item">Father,</li>
              <li class="content-list__item">Son, brother, part of his family,</li>
              <li class="content-list__item">Friend and partner,</li>
              <li class="content-list__item">Businessman,</li>
              <li class="content-list__item">Investor,</li>
              <li class="content-list__item">Philanthropist with a&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;entrepreneurship development,</li>
              <li class="content-list__item">Athlete, sprinter, rower,</li>
              <li class="content-list__item">A spiritual person with a hobby.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="content__text">
              In&nbsp;his book &laquo;Just Do&nbsp;it! Do&nbsp;It&nbsp;Easy!&raquo;, on&nbsp;YouTube, Instagram and telegram channel, Oskar urges to&nbsp;follow his example. He&nbsp;tells how to&nbsp;develop this skill in&nbsp;yourself, and why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;of&nbsp;such great importance for achieving harmony and success not only in&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;entrepreneurs, but also of&nbsp;any person in&nbsp;general.
