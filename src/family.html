              Oskar Hartmann has been happy for many years in&nbsp;his one and only marriage. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;married to&nbsp;Tatiana Hartmann, with whom the entrepreneur has three children: two sons and a&nbsp;daughter. Oskar met his future wife while still a&nbsp;student when he&nbsp;came to&nbsp;Moscow on&nbsp;an&nbsp;experience exchange program. Tatiana is&nbsp;a&nbsp;loyal companion of&nbsp;Oskar in&nbsp;all spheres of&nbsp;life. In&nbsp;her statements, she is&nbsp;in&nbsp;deep solidarity with her husband and believes that the basic business and human qualities of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person are laid down in&nbsp;childhood. The Hartmanns attach great importance to&nbsp;the upbringing and education of&nbsp;children, so&nbsp;they decided not to&nbsp;send them to&nbsp;study abroad, so&nbsp;as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;destroy family ties and take an&nbsp;active part in&nbsp;their formation.

              Applying his own &laquo;decathlon&raquo; principle, Oskar tries not to&nbsp;focus all attention on&nbsp;work activities in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;devote as&nbsp;much time as&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;his family.

              Oskar and Tatiana travel a&nbsp;lot with their children and have already made more than a&nbsp;hundred trips around the world. Hartmann is&nbsp;convinced that if&nbsp;parents want to&nbsp;give their children unconditional love, then they should try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;positive example in&nbsp;everything: in&nbsp;relationships with the second half, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;friendly atmosphere at&nbsp;home, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;quality pastime with the family. The Hartmanns support the ideas and identities of&nbsp;their children, while not trying to&nbsp;make them the best copies of&nbsp;themselves.
