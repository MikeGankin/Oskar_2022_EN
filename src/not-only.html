              Oskar Hartmann took part in&nbsp;the project &laquo;Secret Millionaire&raquo;, which aired on&nbsp;the russian&nbsp;TV channel &laquo;Friday!&raquo;. The concept of&nbsp;the program was that businessmen had to&nbsp;live incognito for five days without any means of&nbsp;livelihood. The hero could only count on&nbsp;the support of&nbsp;strangers and his personal qualities. During the filming Oskar lost 7&nbsp;kg, and eventually spent 5&nbsp;million rubles on&nbsp;gifts to&nbsp;those who helped the traveler Franz&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;fictitious name the businessman came up&nbsp;with in&nbsp;the project. After the show Hartmann paid for the renovation of&nbsp;the apartment and the purchase of&nbsp;new furniture for the family with whom he&nbsp;lived. In&nbsp;addition, the entrepreneur presented 250 thousand rubles for the purchase of&nbsp;a&nbsp;wheelchair for the boy. Oskar transferred 3&nbsp;million rubles to&nbsp;a&nbsp;volunteer organization that helped Hartmann without acknowledging that he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;millionaire.

              Oskar Hartmann was diagnosed with an&nbsp;incurable disease&nbsp;&mdash; Bekhterev&rsquo;s disease (Ankylosing spondylitis). This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;chronic joint disease, followed by&nbsp;the spinal vertebrae of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person growing together, and eventually making a&nbsp;person literally bend. However, for the businessman the doctors&rsquo; conclusions did not become a&nbsp;verdict, but turned into motivation for regular sports.
